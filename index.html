                   <p>I self taught myself how to code and worked as an instructional media specialist for a curriculum design firm but started out coding inline css and javascript. This is a sample of my early work but I have quite a bit of early stuff on <a href="https://github.com/lesliemo">github</a> as well if you'd like to see the progression over time.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately I don't have many work samples from building online courses in Moodle and Canvas for Universities because the work was proprietary but I will be adding more work samples from recent work soon.</p>
                <p>I DO, however, have sample works I can share from my time as an Adobe Education Trainer through the Education Exchange. Will add soon.</p>
                  <p>I took this course to brush up since I hadn't used javascript in awhile and wanted the opportunity to receive some formal training to be able to identify any skills gaps. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that although I did have skills gaps, the instructors lectures where very thorough and accessible and I will definitely be a better coder because of this experience.</p>

                   <p class="m-3">Monica Leslie is a dedicated STEAM educator and recent graduate of the Master of Architecture program at the University of California, Berkeley. With a passion for design justice, eco design, and health equity, Monica’s work bridges the worlds of architecture, education, and community engagement. At UC Berkeley, she specialized in reimagining architectural practice so that it is used as a liberatory tool rather than how the practice has been deployed historically.</p>
                    <p>Monica’s experience spans from developing innovative STEAM curricula for diverse learners to coordinating community-driven health equity initiatives in Louisville, where she worked to address systemic disparities in health and housing. Her approach is rooted in the belief that thoughtful design and inclusive education can transform communities and foster well-being for all.</p>
                    <p>Whether leading participatory budgeting pilots, designing sustainable spaces, or mentoring future changemakers, Monica brings warmth, creativity, and a collaborative spirit to every project. She is committed to empowering others and building a more just, healthy, and sustainable world-one lesson, one space, and one community at a time</p>

                    <h4>From Ashes to Agency:</h4><h6>The role of Freire-based Architecture in the Community-Led Resilience of Post-Wildfire Altadena</h6>
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Masters Thesis</figcaption>
                    <p class="m-3">What if, rather than using top-down approaches to design, architecture was used as a liberatory tool to foster healing, belonging, and repair?</p>
                    <p class="m-3">My final M.Arch thesis aimed to demonstrate how co-design and trauma-informed practices can lead to more equitable, culturally sensitive, and resilient outcomes in post-disaster contexts. It draws from Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, which aims to empower communities historically excluded from shaping their built environment rather than rely on colonial top-down approaches.</p>
                    <p class="m-3">Freire posits that those who have experienced oppression may internalize and replicate oppressive patterns, seeking higher status within the hierarchy of oppression so that the oppression no longer applies to them. To disrupt this cycle, he advocates for liberatory praxis that empowers individuals to work collectively to prevent replicating these harmful dynamics.</p>                    
                <p class="m-3">This research proposes to shift the architect's role from expert to facilitator when working with communities who have experienced community-level trauma coupled with a history of systemic oppression and inequitable resource distribution, isms, and phobias. It advocates avoiding misguided saviorism to instead work toward genuine community-led development. The research also examines how architectural practice can either perpetuate dependency and displacement or equip communities with resources to work toward their own liberation.</p>
                <p class="m-3">To do this I analyzed the recovery efforts in Altadena after the wildfires in January to better understand how this approach could apply to post-disaster reconstruction projects</p>

                    <center><h4>My Story</h4></center>
                    <p>Through a lot of hard work and community support, I, a first-gen, low income student just completed my Masters of Architecture degree from the University of California Berkeley which is wild given how hard I have had to work my way out of poverty and other forms of adversity. But I made it! 🙏🏿</p>

                    <p>For context, I didn't have the traditional education arch. There was a time in my life when I was homeless but I was offered a full 4 year tuition scholarship to complete my undergraduate degree.</p>

                    <p>It's been 2 decades since I re-taught myself math after failing a math class at Michigan State. But I credit the late Sheila Tobias, a professor at Princeton, who refuted the idea that women didn't have mathematical minds for giving me the kind of affirming guidance to try again and work my way up to Calculus 3 and the completion of my undergraduate education.</p>

                    <p>Years later after learning how to code and working in curriculum design, community organizing, and public health, I worked in municipal government. But the death of Breonna Taylor and other Black leaders in my community facing role on behalf of the local government made it difficult to continue in that capacity so based on community feedback I chose to learn a skill that could actually change the material conditions of groups who have been historically marginalized by inequitable resource distribution, isms, and phobias in our institutions and policies. It certainly wasn't an easy feat so completing grad school as a first generation student is a big deal. Especially given that social justice hasn't historically been a core value of the industry I selected.</p>

                    <p>So what's next?</p>

                    <p>While I will be taking a few months to update my portfolio and look for full-time work in community led design, I will also be working as a Bay area STEAM educator teaching students how to code, do robotics, ai, and graphic design.</p>

                    <p>If you know of social mission aligned architecture firms that have positions available that you think might be an appropriate fit for an entry level architect with my unique perspective and experiences, please feel free to send those recommendations. </p>

                    <p>Introductions are also welcome.</p>

                </div>
                 <p>Figure 1: shows ESRI data prior to the LA wildfires in January of 2025</p>
                 <p>Figure 2: shows the extent of structural damage in Altadena that was documented in the Cal Fire Damage Maps on Esri. The structures in red represent the homes that were lost and the structures in blue are what remains.</p> 
                 <p>Figure 3: are maps that illustrate critical infrastructure that existed or may have been missing prior to the Altadena wildfires. This slide also includes analysis of evacuation routes, which proved to be a barrier when the wildfires erupted as well as a bit of site analysis of the sun path and wind directions that may inform how future structures should be built to maximize daylighting or increase fire resistance in the event of a future fire event.</p>
                 <p>Figure 4: In the thesis presentation I note to the reviewers that once critical infrastructure and site analysis are performed, this provides the architect the opportunity to initiate community-led decision-making through the co-creation of resources like asset maps, using maps and dot exercises to determine what kind of resources should be prioritized and if needed built to increase community resilience. This also creates the opportunities to engage in shared dialogue around site selection, program amentities for the site, etc.</p><p>But how does this translate to architecture? The following images demonstrate how a speculative group of decisions could translate into a building massing, space planning, and program of a particular site. In the case of this particular slide I demonstrate how a speculative decision was made to possibly place a resilience hub along Fair Oaks given that this corridor is the most direct evacuation route toward the highway that wouldn't redirect residents back toward the fire. </p>
                 <p>Figure 5: demonstrates massing strategies that could be used to create a mixed use development that addresses many of the pain points residents raised on social media, in community meetings, and with the SOCAL NOMA chapter of architects. The proposed mixed use development would need to have lots of daylight, ventillation and accessible circulation corridors, public and private spaces to gather, and transitional housing to accommodate many of the multi-generational families that have been displaced and construction labor force.</p>
                 <p>Figure 6: speculatively behaves as if residents agreed to build the mixed use development that would serve as a resilience hub at the corner of Ventura and Fair Oaks nex to the cemetary on a commercial lot rather than encroach on any residents' private property. </p>
                 <p>Figure 7: shows what that structure could look like in this case from the perspective of underground parking and shows which entrances shoppers and residents can use to access the building</p>
                 <p>Figure 8: shows what that structure could look like on the ground floor</p>
                 <p>Figure 9: shows what that structure could look like on the second floor</p>
                 <p>Figure 10: shows what that structure could look like on the third floor</p>
                 <p>Figure 11: shows what that structure could look like on the fourth floor</p>
                 <p>Figure 12: shows what that structure could look like on the roof</p>
                 <p>Figure 13: shows what this speculative project would look like from the front and side views</p>
                 <p>Figure 14-17: provides an example of how residents decisions could result in an occupiable building</p>

                       </div> <p>The way that I chose to approach the need for housing centered in collective care was through the creation of a mixed use development that combines supportive services with worker-owned cooperatives to create spaces where residents could experience a shared sense of ownership and a sense of dignity and belonging.</p>
                        <p>The commercial space on the ground floor is designed to not only provide dignified employment opportunities and skill building for building occupants, but also provides amenities that allow the space to connect the site to the fabric of the surrounding community. </p> 
                        <p>In addition to providing counseling and supportive services, a community kitchen, laundromat, bodega, gym, and barber shop, the space is activated by worker owned cooperatives designed to show compatible uses like the ceramics studio and a plant store, art supply store and art gallery, gym and juicery. The site also houses a coding school and coworking space, graphic design firm, screen printer, and copy shop.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the public circulation, the ground floor uses two breezeway corridors to activate the site and create a sense of connectivity with the commercial spaces that currently exist. </p>
                        <p>The private circulation begins at the 8th street breezeway. The elevators to access the residential spaces are located in the central core. There’s also a stairway in the corridor that serves as a feature stair and light well.</p>
                        <p>The 3 unit types are arranged to bring in natural light, with market rate units facing Washington Street, affordable units facing 8th street, and supportive housing overlooking the rear plaza.</p>
